Nice small design. very portable and handy. you do not need to carry charger.You can carry in your pocket.Charge and Sync data any where with micro USB (or Android Phone) Charger or Data cable.
Outbuild is cool, but socket is very plasticky and small.
Its a very lame device fits very badly into the universal charger pin.Ant its very vulnerable !Always disconnects from charging u will have to keep adjusting the device in order to complete ur charge! No perfection at all!
The most worst product which I brought on Amazon.  After connecting to my iphone, immediately phone given a message "This cable or accessory is not certified and may not work reliably with this iphone".  It didn't charged single time also.
The product is compact, works fine, and is also white to match the Apple Charger (the important things fandom sees in increasing order!)Initial attempt - worked well, no problems (it is not a light saber after all.)For the price, a great steal and a must have!
Quality is not upto the mark, half the time you need struggle with this to charge.
Not at all worth it - Not even close to original - Would spoil your battery - This is a chinese product worth Rs. 18 - Plastic Breaks as well - No Point buying it
This is not certified for ios 7 and above.
