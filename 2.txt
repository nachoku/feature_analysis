

 though the product was working fine and efficiently charging multiple items but now it has stopped working .. really dissapointed :(
there iis nda 

 It is supposed to be 10000Mah. My phone has a battery of 2300 Mah, it should atleast give my four full charges instead it only give me 2.5. Build quality is good. 

 This is the third time I am getting wrong item. This time I had ordered Romoss PH50-401 Solo 5 Charger having following Key Features of Romoss PH50-401 Solo 5 Charger as was displayed on site,
• LED Flash Light
• LED Battery Level Indicator
• PC + ABS Alloy Plastic Structure
• 10000 mAh Capacity 
On the contrary I have just received Romoss PH50-403 Solo 5 which does not have LED Flash light but rest all features. 
P;lease ensure that either I get Romoss PH50-401 Solo 5 having above displayed features or cancel the order and refund money. 
Please stop advertising your site as your suppliers can not supply what they advertise and cheat the customer. This is the third incident and I am thinking seriously of going to consumer court to seek compensation for the kind of harassment I have faced by ordering this item through your site apart from blocking my money each time for more then 15 days.  

 Purchased this for RS 900/- and its works very good for heavyusers. 
Having 10000mah capacity can be used for 4 times charge for 2600mah batteries which i am using for now. 
Takes around 6 hours for charge, but absolutely worth the time. 
Not recommended for people requiring sleeky size as the size is a little big comparatively to other sleek power-banks. 

 charges my zenfone2 3 times for 1 full charge. backup is very good and is built for rough daily usage. 

 As above no subject of warranty is mention so i want to know the warranty of the power bank so plz let me know as fast you can 

 its a bit heavy but charges my phone thrice completely,
i would recommend it to others because its quite cheap and sturdy 

 it is already spoiled. please do not buy. it will get spoiled in two days. it doesn't get charged at all. it was a mistake buying that. flipkart should not entertain such sellers. 

 i give it 4 stats for this. 
the size in the image shown here is small. 
but actual size is bigger than i thought. 

 my personal experience product not good working .only charge 2 time. 10000mah charge minimum 4-5 times 2000mah moblie. Flipkart returned police is very worse .

 just 1 week working , no feed back by seller , dont buy this product .please move on another product................................................................................ 

 I am using Romoss PH50-401 Solo 5 Charger for past 3 months......really good .....worth for money....one draw back is long time for charging....  

 Its very nice product as i am using it from last 8 months and fully satisfied as it charges my micromax canvas battery at least twice if fully blown away or thrice if at least 30-35% is there. It itself takes 5-6 hours to charge and after charging it fully we can keep it idle for many days such as 8-10 days(as i tried this only) and will get same response. Happy as it solves my need and as per expectation.......becoz of satisfaction i ordered 3 more for family and friends and they are too fine 

 This seller is original romoss product seller. good service . if you buy from romoss india you will get all india service. this seller have customer care no and warranty sticker on the device . 

 Pros : The product has a good finish, and provides the stated capacity. It could charge my 3000mAH phone thrice. It has two output ports, one rated at 2A and the other at 1A.  
Cons: It is surprisingly large and heavy and takes a long time to recharge. This is to be expected considering its capacity. 
Unfortunately, the higher capacity output port failed, and does not deliver current. The product is still usable, as the 1A port continues to work. 

 I have been using this from the past oe month with no issues whatsoever. The powerbank is able to charge both my phones Moto G3 and Asus Zenphone laser simultaneously with ease.  
Pros - 
Lightweight
Phones are charged very fast
Led indicator that is accurate 
Cons - 
Takes too long to charge 

 I used the power bank for two days and it charges the 1800mah phone for 4.5 times. Compared to other power banks it seems to perform well. 
Pros:
Good Design
Battery Indicator
Charge Faster
Cons:
Bit Heavier 

 I am using this for about a month now. I found this product good and useful especially in long travels. it gives 4-5 Full chargingfor my mobile. 

 I am quite happy with the performance of the Romosss Power Bank. It is worth buying. Only Con is the cable is very short and it is difficult to use charger . The cable length is suitable for Laptop. 

 Very Efficient Product, No Flaws
I would recommend this product. 
Impressed with the Packing and Delivery of the product. 

 this power bank is awesome. it charge my phn(1800mah) 5 times without charging the power bank. very useful, but its size is too bulky, may be because of 10000mah but it doesn't matter. the output port 2.1 A doesn't compatible with all devices. it takes 12-13 hours for full charge(too much)..otherwise product is good and reached safely :D 

 it is awesome product...if you are looking for long lasting battery bank..defiantly go for it...awesome battery bank...but it woul be more convient if they had included Dong to charge it... 

 its an efficient power bank, good charging power, but it takes a little bit more time to charge itself & gives a good output current 

 So far works great. The only disadvantage is that it takes a looong time to charge even with a rapid charger. On a full charge, I have used it to charge 4 mi range android phones and it still had some juice left. 

 The Product was neatly packed and was received yesterday . so far it is working satisfactorily. I would recommend this if you are looking for two outputs 1amp and 2.1 amp . 
The weight is a bit heavy but is anticipated as it is giving two outputs. 

 i have been using this for the past 6 months , i feel it's really a good one because of its power storage capacity. you can do full charge for 4 or 5 times to your mobile using this . 
Weight is a bit concern about this when compare to other weightless power banks.. over all its a good product go for it. 

 Very good product. Purchased 3 months back and Found no issues as of now. Look wise, its nice product, no issues with charging and loading. 

 1. Size of the power bank is very big compared to the pic shown in the site.
2. It will take around 12 hrs of time to fully charge the PB while other PB's will take less time than this. It is very heavy to carry.
3. I have Mi Xiomi 5200 mAh PB and it is working fine. My suggestion is go for the Mi power banks. 

 NICE TO HAVE IT.SUPER BACK UP AND STAND BY TOO.i got it before 2days but local delivery man gave it after a day 1y. 

 Charger is not supplied with the product. Over all the Power bank is good but without charger how can we charged it. God knows 

 Not so good as I expected and the packaging disappointed me.
It is a bit heavy power bank and what freaks me out is that there is no charger with the product.
The charging cable is very small..
